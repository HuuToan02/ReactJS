      "body": "TypeScript is not free. It comes with heavy development-time penalties and minimal safety guarantees, all while preserving the worst aspects of JavaScript. TypeScript makes JavaScript harder to write, longer to develop, much harder to test*, and lulls you into a false sense of type security. Too often do people forget that writing TypeScript is playing pretend . You’re participating in a type hint system, not a type system. You get no runtime benefits or safety guarantees, and the bare minimum of type inference. Any value added by TypeScript is based on the assumption that you decorate everything you write with accurate types. * Much harder to test if you’re using a DI runtime a la Angular or NestJS Many of the blights of TypeScript can be seen as having fallen out of their goals of TypeScript being a “non-binary” language choice; that JavaScript interop and gradual TypeScript adoption come first, and the language makes no assumptions about the type of code you write. This lack of vision has cemented the JavaScript (now TypeScript) community in some pretty heavy anti-patterns like using classes for dependency injection, inheritance for code re-use, and exception-based error handling.",

      "body": "Why do we use it?\nIt is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).\n\n\nWhere does it come from?\nContrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum",
